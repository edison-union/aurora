# Aurora

Aurora is an EQ visualizer created with Touchdesigner.

## Dependencies
- [Soundflower 2.0b2](https://github.com/mattingalls/Soundflower)

## How it works
Aurora analyses the input from Soundflower and uses 3 audio filter operators to break the frequencies up into
mids, highs, and lows. These are then sent to a ring component, which adds noise to a particle system, which then has
feedback/blur applied to it, creating the aurora effect.
